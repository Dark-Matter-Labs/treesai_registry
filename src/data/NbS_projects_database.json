The project, being led by Southside Housing Association in partnership with Glasgow City Council flood reduction strategy, rainwater management on site will alleviate burden on city sewer system that is getting closer to capacity. With the formation of the basin and swales, the excavated soil will be kept on site to create small rolling hills to add to the playful aspect of each space, and create elevated viewing areas around the multi use games pitch.

      "project_description": "Enabled by funding from the Glasgow City Region City Deal (www.glasgowcityregion.co.uk), Drumchapel Surface Water Management Plan has been delivered by Glasgow City Council to create a series of series of embankments and storage areas along the line of the Garscadden Burn in the vicinity of Southdeen Avenue and Kinfauns Drive. The storage areas manage high flows during storm events, using the natural valley area as temporary floodplain storage to hold back water and reduce flood risk both upstream and downstream. This also reduces pressure on the combined sewer network, alleviating development constraints and ensuring drainage infrastructure is more resilient in a changing climate. Consideration of further interventions in the Drumchapel area is ongoing, as identified in the recently published Clyde and Loch Lomond Flood Risk Management Plan. Phase 1 (2014), funded by EDC in collaboration with Scottish Water, implemented SWM solutions in public open space, close to housing and schools. Sections of the local burn were de-culverted, and a skating pond reinstated to provide flood storage areas and enhance local biodiversity. Areas of raised ground aided management of above ground flows with play areas relocated and upgraded to deliver community benefits (Figure 3). Phase 2 (2016) was a £18m investment by Scottish Water to upgrade infrastructure and increase network capacity to address sewer flooding and open up development land to the north-west of the city. Phase 3 (2020) funding came via £5m from the Glasgow City Region City Deal and was used to further reduce flood risks in EDC and downstream city catchments. \n\n",

These new works will also allow the Broad Street development by Clyde Gateway, and various social and private sector housing developments within the Camlachie Burn catchment: all of these are unable to proceed until sufficient drainage capacity is provided by the Camlachie Burn through delivery of the third phase of works. The works will also tackle the occurrence of flooding at Rigby Street and Shettleston Road – a problem for both the local community and commuters. The financial contribution of up to £2.25million from the council will – alongside £750,000 from the Health and Social Care Partnership (HSCP) as a contribution from the Parkhead Health and Social Care Hub – see the removal, treatment and disposal of silt and debris from the Camlachie Burn culvert between Shettleston Road and Biggar Street; and the installation of a penstock at the upstream end of the Camlachie Burn Overflow (CBO).  The council said that the works will be delivered within 12 months, with a site start expected in six months.",

Using blue-green infrastructure will provide additional benefits in terms of urban cooling, air quality, biodiversity and placemaking.
