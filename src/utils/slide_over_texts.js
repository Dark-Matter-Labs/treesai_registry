          To better understand a project we have developed a classification system, with typologies
          to enable the rapid understanding of a projectâ€™s existing and planned characteristics,
          thus a faster modelling of costs and impacts.
        </p>
        <p>Each typology is defined in terms of its biophysical features. </p>
        <p>
          We divide these features into three main categories that provide different functions to
          the urban climate; vegetation layers, ground surfaces and building structures.
